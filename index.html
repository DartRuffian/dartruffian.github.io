                <p>
                    Hi there! My name is <span class="bold">DartRuffian</span>, but I may also just go by <span class="bold">Dart</span>.
                    I use <span class="bold">He/They/It pronouns</span> and identify as a gay man.<br>
                    I primarily prefer to do back-end development, since the majority of my skill-set involves <span class="bold">math</span>,
                    <span class="bold">science</span> and <span class="bold">data analysis</span>. I do however also work with HTML, CSS, and
                    Javascript to work on relatively simple front-end applications; although these are much less frequent.
                </p>

                <h3>Primary Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    The languages that I work within the most are by far <span class="bold">Python</span> and <span class="bold">C#</span>. Python is
                    by far the language I have the most experience in, but have been reaching out to learn new skills and languages. Some of those
                    languages include C#, <span class="bold">HTML</span>, <span class="bold">CSS</span>, and <span class="bold">Javascript</span>; 
                    and my learning of these languages inspired me to put this page together to demonstrate my skills. I am also very experienced
                    with working within different frameworks, and many of those examples include the several
                    <a class="bold" href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> bots
                    that I have developed, which can be found on my <a class="bold" href="https://github.com/DartRuffian">Github</a> page. These were mostly personal side projects and thus were not hosted permanently, but I learned a great deal
                    of skills from working on them.
